# Template - Live Polling

Here is a basic "multiple choice" question. The results will be displayed on the next page, showing both the choice you made as well as a summary of all the choices made by other participants.

```{r}
sd_question(
  type  = 'mc',
  id    = 'penguins',
  label = "Which type of penguin do you like the best?",
  option = c(
    'Adélie'    = 'adelie',
    'Chinstrap' = 'chinstrap',
    'Gentoo'    = 'gentoo'
  )
)

sd_next()
```
