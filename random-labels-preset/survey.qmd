# Demo - Predefined Random Labels

Here is a basic "multiple choice" question where the labels are randomly sampled from 1 to 100.

The random samples are grabbed from a **pre-defined** csv file.

If you refresh the page, the options should change.

```{r}
sd_output("q1", type = "question")
sd_next()
```

:::

::: {.sd_page id=page2}

This is another page in your survey.
```{r}
sd_next()
```

:::

::: {.sd_page id=end}

This it the last page in the survey

```{r}
sd_close()
```
